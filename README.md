Application created for the Compose Google Developers training. The application allows the user to make a digital lemonade with a random number of button clicks.

The application starts with an image of a lemon tree and a message for the user to tap and harvest a lemon.

After the first click, a lemon and a different text appears. The number of clicks needed to squeeze is randomly generated.

After the lemon is squeezed, a glass of lemonade will appear with the text "Tap the lemonade to drink it". After the click, the glass will appear empty.

The user needs to tap the empty glass again to restart the application flow.
